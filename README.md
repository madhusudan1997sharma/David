# David
Let your PC be controlled by Speech Recogntion. David is a speech recognition based system which can do several tasks from opening a software program to searching for a keyword over the internet. Developed in C#, it mocks the AI functionality(not particularly) hardcoded in the system. Configure the NAudio support library and create a commands list text file in the documents to enable it.

Have fun!
